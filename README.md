# terminal-games
A set of low-graphical games written wholly in C
Just an experiment on Game Dev using the primitive features of the C language

Files like chan_graphics.c or chan_init.c function as header files and were written by me. They are required for all games except TicTicToe

The dynamic games are extremely laggy, because they dont utilise the resources of the CPU
Since only one thread of execution is available, only one task in completed at a time
There are a lot of bugs, which haven't been eliminated
A lot of improvements could've been made, but weren't, since better paradigms of Game Dev were available.
